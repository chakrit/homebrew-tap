# Homebrew formula for Kue.
#
# Canonical home: this file is the source of truth, but `brew install` reads it
# from a TAP repository, not from here. It must be published to
# `chakrit/homebrew-tap` at path `Formula/kue.rb` for `brew install
# chakrit/tap/kue` to work. See
# docs/notes/2026-06-16-release-and-homebrew-setup.md for the publish steps.
#
# The `kue` binary is self-contained (Lean's runtime is linked statically; only
# system libs remain dynamic), so we ship the prebuilt release asset per
# platform and install it directly. Three assets are published per release:
#
#   macOS arm64   kue-aarch64-apple-darwin       (built by scripts/release.sh)
#   Linux x86_64  kue-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu   (built by scripts/release-linux.sh)
#   Linux arm64   kue-aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu  (built by scripts/release-linux.sh)
#
# On each release, bump `version` and the url/sha256 inside each platform block.
# Each sha256 is the checksum of the matching release asset:
#   shasum -a 256 <asset>
